# OfferOptimizer

OfferOptimizer is a machine learning solution built during the HCLTech Hackathon @ NSUT to predict the optimal discount a customer is likely to accept based on their past purchases and loyalty tier. This helps businesses optimize promotional spending, personalize offers, and improve customer engagement.  
The model achieved a **25% improvement in recall** compared to the baseline.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Modern retail systems depend heavily on discounts to influence buying behavior. But ineffective discounting leads to revenue loss. OfferOptimizer tackles this by predicting the *most suitable discount* for each customer using their historical purchase data and loyalty classification.  
This model enhances targeted marketing and minimizes unnecessary promotional expenditure.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

To maximize promotional effectiveness and return on investment, this project predicts the likelihood of a customer accepting a certain discount.  
The prediction is based on:

- Customer spending behavior  
- Loyalty tier   

The goal is to generate personalized discount recommendations that balance customer satisfaction and business profitability.
